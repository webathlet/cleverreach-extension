## Frequently Asked Questions

#### Why would I use the API instead of the source code provided within my CleverReach account?
Using the API will allow you to push and pull data from CleverReach. 
This allows things like smooth form submission via Ajax and custom error handling.

#### Is it secure?
No customer data is stored within your WordPress database. 
We heavily rely on the security of CleverReach which is [tested and verified](https://www.cleverreach.com/security) according to German standards.

#### Having problems with the PHP SOAP Extension?
Check the [PHP SOAP wiki page](https://github.com/hofmannsven/cleverreach-extension/wiki/PHP-SOAP-Extension) for further information.

#### How can I customize the sign-up form or the error messages?
